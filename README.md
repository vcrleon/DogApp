# DogApp
Android Final -
I attempted the login, breeds and dogs activity. I didn't get to the photo activity because I wasn't able to pass the list of dog information for each corresponding dog. I set up Shared Preferences but didn't get it to work successfully as it doesn't save the user's credentials when closing the app. I also didn't get to write the logic to check if the user was already registered. For the BreedsActivity, I was able to set up the cardviews and tried to implement the OnClickListener interface, but it wasn't working, so I had to set the onClickListener for each cardview individually. There's a lot of repetitive code, in my opinion, in the Breeds Activity. Finally, I started the Dogs Activity (RecyclerView and XML) but didn't get to display the data or finish the RV since I was able to pass the data (although I think there was a better way of doing so), but didn't get to bind it in the adapter. I spent about an hour trying to make my network call to work (only to find out that I added an extra slash in the URL) which is why I ran out of time. I didn't make the random dog call though or the menu.
